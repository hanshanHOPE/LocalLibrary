This is a single page application based on HTML5 IndexedDB and BootStrap FrameWork, which manages a local database. We can add, remove, update book informations.
Here is a demo page: http://hanshanhope.github.io/LocalLibrary/
Using IndexedDB, we can maintain a offline database in browser.
With BootStrap, I set the basic style of the page and a Model used to update record.
